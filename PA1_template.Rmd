## Loading and preprocessing the data
h <- read.csv("activity.csv",head=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
h$date<-as.Date(p$date, "%d/%m/%Y")
h <-na.omit(h)
g <- h[,c(1,2)]
library(dplyr)
p<- ddply(g,.(date),summarise,Total = sum(steps))


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
